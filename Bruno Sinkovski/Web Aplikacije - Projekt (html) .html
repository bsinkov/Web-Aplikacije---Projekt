               <div class="text">
                   <p>The Chevrolet Corvette, known also as the "Vette" or "Chevy Corvette", is a front engine, rear drive, two-door, two-passenger sports car manufactured and marketed by Chevrolet across more than sixty years of production and seven design generations. As Chevrolet's halo vehicle, the Corvette is widely noted for its performance and distinctive plastic — either fiberglass or composite — bodywork.</p>
				   <p>In 1953, when GM executives were looking to a name the new Chevrolet sports car, assistant director for the Public Relations department Myron Scott suggested Corvette after the small maneuverable warship — and the name was approved. The first model, a convertible, was introduced at the GM Motorama in 1953 as a concept and was followed ten years later, in the 1963 second generation, in coupe and convertible styles. Originally manufactured in Flint, Michigan as well as St. Louis, Missouri, the Corvette has been manufactured since 1981 in Bowling Green, Kentucky.</p>
				   <p>The Corvette has since become widely known as "America's Sports Car". Automotive News said that after 'starring' in the early 1960s television show Route 66, the Corvette became synonymous with freedom and adventure," ultimately becoming both "the most successful concept car in history and the most popular sports car in history".</p>
				   <p>Here it is presented across seven generations:</p>
